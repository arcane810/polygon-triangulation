\Hypertarget{index_md_src_Readme}%
An implementation of polygon triangulation which first partitions the polygon into monotone parts and triangulates the monotone polygons. A \mbox{\hyperlink{class_d_c_e_l}{D\+C\+EL}} is used to store the polygon and its monotone partitioning and the triangulation. Made as a part of the computation geometry course at B\+I\+TS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.
